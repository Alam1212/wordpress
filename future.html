                    <h2>The Future</h2>
                    <p>
                        According to Matt Mullenweg, the future of WordPress is in social, mobile, and as an application platform. In the coming days, WordPress will no
                        longer be just a content management system (CMS), but a dynamic framework that runs all kinds of applications. In the broad future, WordPress
                        could evolve into an operating system for the open web. Matt Mullenweg, quoted at WCEU 2016:
                        “You know, the thing I keep coming back to, and it’s a little cheesy and a little abstract, but WordPress really can be an operating system,
                        for not just the web, but the open web.”
                        The REST API allows you to create applications in any language and run them on WordPress.
                        With this new approach, JavaScript will become more useful in WordPress.
                        The Future of WordPress Security
                        Make your WordPress website more secure by creating backups and updating your site; core, themes, and plugins. As WordPress advances, we would
                        see more advanced security solutions. We would also expect to see more security tools. WordPress website security awareness and improvement of
                        products would be raised by developers. There are future plans to introduce Tide which allows WordPress core to verify that plugins and theme
                        downloads are correct. We can expect to see security tools that take the complexity of securing your website by automation. According to Akshat
                        Choudhury, “There is no silver bullet you can use to solve all your security needs, but rather you need to do many things correctly. Also, it is
                        not a one-time process but an ongoing effort.” Policies such as GDPR will make WordPress more secure as time progresses.
                        Future of WordPress Design
                        All these tools like the live theme customizer point to a future of WordPress where creating professional websites would take hours instead of days.
                        With the advancement of visual page builders like WPBakery Page Builder, Divi, and Elementor, multi-purpose themes, and modern frameworks, beginners
                        have more control over every design aspect of their websites. Front-end design will be valuable in the future, so improve your JavaScript skills.
                        There is a strong focus on improving user experience by using mobile responsiveness.

                        Functionality
                        The future of WordPress offers video marketing. As video grows, we can expect to see WordPress integrate video further.Visual builders currently ship with
                        numerous features which allow you to create and launch super-fast websites. We would also expect to see better translations, because the WPML plugin doesn’t
                        cover this functionality. We would also see more wordPress apps that run on REST API.
                        The Future of WordPress Support
                        WordPress has a lot of great support through the community support forums or commercial services. We can expect the number of volunteer supporters to grow.
                        Numerous managed WordPress hosts will improve their support to provide new changes as well as the diverse needs of their customers.
                        Community
                        WordPress has grown since the last ten years. The platform is one of the biggest and most engaged communities on the internet. WordPress competitors such as Wix,
                        Shopify, and Squarespace would not be able to compete with WordPress because of the new improvements such as the Gutenberg editor. In the future, it is possible
                        that WordPress will power 35% of the internet by 2020. WordPress already powers about 30% of the net.
                        Conclusion
                        The future of WordPress is exciting with each new update and tool. We predict that WordPress is only going to improve and get better.
