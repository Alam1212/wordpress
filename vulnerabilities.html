                    <h2>Vulnerabilities</h2>
                    <p>
                        Since 2007, 2008, and 2015, numerous security issues have been discovered on Word press. According to Secunia,
                        WordPress in April 2009 had seven unpatched security advisories out of 32 total. Numerous high-profile search engine
                        optimization as well as low-profile commercial blogs like AdSense had a WordPress vulnerability. The WordPress 2.1.1
                        version had a vulnerability on one of the site’s web servers that allowed a hacker to introduce dupable code in the form of a
                        back door to some WordPress 2.1.1. This problem was resolved in the WordPress 2.1.2 release. A study in May 2007 revealed that
                        98 % of WordPress blogs were dupable because they were running obsolete and unsupported versions of WordPress. WordPress introduced a
                        one click automated process in version 2.7 (released in December 2008) to fix the dupable problem. However, the filesystem security settings
                        required to enable the update process can be an additional risk. Stefan Esser, the founder of the PHP Security Response Team in June 2007
                        commented on the security of WordPress saying that problems with the application’s architecture made it unnecessarily difficult to write code
                        that is secure from SQL injection vulnerabilities. It was found in June 2013 that 50 of the most downloadable WordPress plugins were vulnerable
                        to common web attacks such as SQL injection and XSS.

                    <p>
                        A study of the top-10 e-commerce plugins showed that seven of them were vulnerable. Automatic
                        background updates were introduced in WordPress 3.7 to promote better security. WordPress installations can be secured with security plugins that
                        prevent user enumeration, hide resources and oppose probes. Another way to secure your WordPress installations is by keeping all WordPress
                        installation, themes, and plugins updated, using only trusted themes and plugins, editing the site’s .htaccess file to avoid many types of
                        SQL injection attacks and block unauthorized access to sensitive files. Developer tools like WPScan, WordPress Auditor and WordPress Sploit
                        framework manufactured by 0pc0deFR can be used to analyze potential vulnerabilities. It was reported in March 2015 that an SE0 plugin called
                        Yoast used by over 14 million users had a vulnerability which could lead to an exploit where hackers could do a Blind SQL injection. WordPress
                        introduced a newer version 1.7.4 to fix the Blind SQL injection issue. In January of 2017 another WordPress vulnerability was discovered by Sucuri
                        that dealt with the WordPress REST API that would allow any unauthenticated user to modify any post or page within a site running WordPress 4.7 or
                        higher. WordPress released a high priority patch to version 4.7.2 to address the WordPress REST API problem.
